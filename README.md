## About
The restaurant page is the fifth project in The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript course. One of the main aims was to use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle the project's files. Each piece of content is kept inside of its own module and dynamically renderered to the page. The buttons in the page's nav are used to easily navigate between and load the content to the page.
<br/><br/>
These are some of the challenges I faced while making this project:
- Getting each button to load its corresponding content
- Ensuring the previously selected content is removed before the next is loaded
